# In general, system software such as Bedrock should not manipulate /usr/local.

#
# However, dbus's dbus-daemon-launch-helper seems to ignore /etc/dbus-1/
# configuration extending the search path.  See
# https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92458 for a discussion on the
# matter.  For example:
#
# > Note that d-d-l-h only reads .service files from standard hard-coded paths,
# > not from any additional paths that you might have configured
#
# Since /usr/local/share/dbus is included in the hard-coded paths, is not used
# by most package managers, and is rarely used by end-users, it's the cleanest
# option available to teach dbus about /bedrock/cross.

# Bedrock ensures that, should certain files exist in /etc, they will include
# content specified at another file path.  If the desired content is not found
# in the file it is automatically appended to the end.
#
# The keys are file paths relative to /etc, and the values are paths to files
# whose content must be included if the key's file exists in /etc.

# If you alter either the key/values in this section, or the actual content of
# the values, run `brl apply` to apply the change.  Do this before rebooting
# to ensure any old content is removed.

[env-vars]
#
# Many programs search environment variables consisting of a colon-separated
# list of directories.  We can use these to teach these programs about
# cross-stratum content.
#
# Generally, the fields fall into three categories, which should be in the
# following order:
#
# - The file must come from a specific stratum.
#     - For example, `reboot` should be provided by the stratum providing the
#     current init.
#     - Typically, these are provided by `/bedrock/cross/pin/[...]`.
# - The file must come from the local stratum.
#     - Bedrock Linux assumes strata are self-sufficient in terms of hard
#     dependencies.  Thus, if something has a hard dependency on a given file
#     that file *must* be available locally.
#     - For example, if a given distro's `/bin/sh` is provided by bash, that
#     distro's scripts may use bash-isms, and thus another distro's `/bin/sh`
#     may be unsuitable.
#     - Typically these values are the traditional values of the given
#     environment variable.
# - The file may come from any stratum.
#     - If the above two categories don't apply, we know the program isn't
#     picky about the specific version of the given file, and thus any distro
#     may provide it.
#     - Typically, these are provided by `/bedrock/cross/[...]`.
