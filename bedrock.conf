# In general, system software such as Bedrock should not manipulate /usr/local.
# Bedrock should favor configuring /etc files instead.
#
# However, dbus's dbus-daemon-launch-helper seems to ignore /etc/dbus-1/
# configuration extending the search path.  See
# https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92458 for a discussion on the
# matter.  For example:
#
# > Note that d-d-l-h only reads .service files from standard hard-coded paths,
# > not from any additional paths that you might have configured
#
# Since /usr/local/share/dbus is included in the hard-coded paths, is not used
# by most package managers, and is rarely used by end-users, it's the cleanest
# option available to teach dbus about /bedrock/cross.

# Bedrock ensures that, should certain files exist in /etc, they will include
# content specified at another file path.  If the desired content is not found
# in the file it is automatically appended to the end.
#
# The keys are file paths relative to /etc, and the values are paths to files
# whose content must be included if the key's file exists in /etc.

# If you alter either the key/values in this section, or the actual content of
# the values, run `brl apply` to apply the change.  Do this before rebooting
# to ensure any old content is removed.

[env-vars]
#
# Many programs search environment variables consisting of a (usually colon
# separated) list of directories.  We can use these to teach these programs
# about cross-stratum content.
#
# These variables are typically searched in listed order.  To manage this
# order, the configuration below is broken up into three sections for each
# variable:
#
# - PREFIX:<envvar> entries.  Bedrock ensures these are at the front of the
# environment variable.  These are used to ensure a given resource is provided
# by a specific stratum.  For example, this ensures `reboot` is provided by the
# init stratum.
#
# - INFIX:<envvar> entries.  These are used to ensure a given entry comes from
# the local stratum.  For example, some software may request to be launched by
# sh via `#!/usr/bin/env sh` but utilize bash-isms which are valid on some
# distros which symlink `sh` to `bash`, but not others which don't.  Such
# software must use the local stratum's `sh` to ensure the `bash` shell they
# expect is utilized.
#
# - SUFFIX:<envvar> entries.  Bedrock ensures these are at the end of the
# environment variable.  Given the PREFIX:<envvar> (specific stratum) and
# INFIX:<envvar> (local stratum) do not contain the item, it likely does not
# matter which stratum provides it, and so this contains resources from any
# strata which provide the resource.
